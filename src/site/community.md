subtitle: Strategies & best practice for getting content from your community
---

- Identify the individuals or social profiles that you think might be able to offer the maximum first-person insights or expertise about a subject that you are interested in investigating. Eg: a group of COVID-19 survivors from Italy who are in the high-risk age bracket.   

- Be intuitive about how you can make that initial contact with someone from that community. Eg: find a Facebook group that some of them are part of and join it. That may help you establish some contact.  

- To gain the trust of an individual or community it’s important that you communicate to them at the outset what are your motivations in reaching out to them.     

- Do you understand the language they speak? If not, find someone who does. If they have posted stuff in a language you don’t read, a good starting point could be [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).  

- When soliciting content or reaching out to your target community through public social media platforms add a hashtag (#) and a keyword with your message and ask people to respond with that same word and #. The #keyword combination can help you comb through your social media feed for all the responses that you have received.  

- Create a Google Form with some basic questions to circulate among your target community. It can help you learn a bit about them and understand how they may be able to contribute to your project or story.

- Recognise the time, energy, and effort that someone might be putting in to give you relevant content. Give them due credit to incentivize them to share more authentic content.
